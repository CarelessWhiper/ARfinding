# ARfinding

Project title: Indoor object locating combined with AR navigation

Group members: LU Yilin, LUO Yuning, Yang Runxi, SHAO Mengxi

Description: In this project, we propose an interesting and vivid application to find lost items. Items are connected with Bluetooth Low-Energy(BLE) beacons and users could use the application to track these misplaced items by distance indication and Augmented Reality mark and pointer. As using AR technology to visualize the direction and distance of the object, the application is able to make the finding procedure more efficient, interesting and vivid. To implement this function, we developed an App on iOS with ARKit, integrated with the AR location guidance and distance estimation.

The final achievement could be run on 【AR Distance Calculator】 file.
